        Generate a comprehensive pytest-bdd Gherkin feature file for the endpoint "/BookStore/v1/Books" with HTTP method "GET".
        Parameters: [].

        Create meaningful scenarios that:
        1. Test the basic functionality of the endpoint
        2. Include edge cases and error conditions
        3. Consider the business context and user workflows
        4. Follow a logical flow of operations

        Format strictly as a .feature file with:
        - Feature: A clear description of the endpoint's purpose
        - Background: Common setup steps if needed
        - Scenarios: Multiple test cases with Given/When/Then steps
        - Use tables where appropriate for data variations

        Output only the feature text, no extra commentary.
